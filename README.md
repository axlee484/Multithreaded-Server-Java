# Multithreaded-Server-Java
A simple chat app

to run it do the following

$ git clone https://github.com/axlee484/Multithreaded-Server-Java
$ cd Multithreaded-Server-Java
$ java multithreadedserver.Main

this will start the server. Now you may connect to the Server from the client. The port used here is 2403.
to start a new Client open a new terminal and run the following

$ cd Multithreaded-Server-Java/Client
$ java Client

now put the IP address as your own address(this is hardcoded in the program) i.e. 127.0.0.1
currently 4 simulataneous client threads are supported. You can change it by modifying the Server.java file
